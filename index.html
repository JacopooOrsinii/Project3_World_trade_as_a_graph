      <h1>Project 3: World Trade as a Graph</h1>
      <p>
        This project was carried out as part of the Data Driven Modeling of Complex Systems course taught by Professor Walter Quattrociocchi at the University of Rome La Sapienza. The aim of the research is to explore the potential of representing a complex phenomenon as the world trade, the driving force of our economies, through the statistical methodologies provided by complex systems theory. Can such a robust institution be permanently affected by external events? Does it adapt to these influences? These questions will be examined in the subsequent sections of this research.

      <h1>Dataset Principali</h1>
      <p>
        The data that have been used are taken online and are available to the public, the sources are: the CEPII Database and the World Trade Organisation.
      </p>
      
      <h3>1. CEPII Database (2017 - 2022)</h3>
      <p>
        The first dataset, sourced from the CEPII Database, takes the years from 2017 to 2022 and provides detailed insights into bilateral trade relationships—detailing exporters, importers, and the corresponding trade values. Here is an example:
      </p>

      <h3>2. World Trade Organisation Data (2017 - 2024)</h3>
      <p>
        Complementing the previous information, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) dataset offers a macro-level perspective, these data are divided in 3 smaller datasets that refer to the imports, the exports and the activity (which is (imports+exports)/2), for the years from 2017 to 2024. Then, the 3 datasets have a column for the country, a column for the total of imports, exports or activity in that specific month and then the month in which the trade has been completed.

      <h1>Graph features</h1>
      <p>
        The analyzed graph exhibits a dense and highly interconnected structure. Let's describe the graph, referred to the year 2017 of the CEPII dataset, after grouping for the goods that have been trade in order to have only 1 bilateral relationships that sums all the values traded, the graphs for the other years present similar features. The graph has 226 nodes and 26,332 arcs, the network reaches a density of 0.5178, meaning that over half of all possible connections exist. France emerges as the most influential node, with a maximum degree of 447, highlighting its central role in the network, while Bonaire Island represents the opposite end of the spectrum with a minimum degree of 41. On average, each node connects with 233 others, reflecting a robust level of interconnectivity. These metrics collectively illustrate a complex system where key nodes significantly shape the overall connectivity and dynamics of the network.

      <h1>World trade graph representation</h1>
      <p>
        It was a challenge to represent a graph with 26.000 arcs, then a solution that has been implemented is to represent direct arcs from a Country A to a Country B if Country A is the biggest seller, the country that has exported the most, to Country B. Also the arcs are coloured according to the continent of origin of the exporter.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Year 2017</h3>

      <h3>Year 2022</h3>
      <img src="images/WTG.3.jpg" alt="WTG.3" width="800" height="600">

      <p>
        The analysis reveals that while the overall structure of the graph has remained largely unchanged, there are subtle yet significant shifts in trade dynamics. China has strategically strengthened its ties with parts of Europe and the Middle East, all while maintaining its position as the leading exporter across Africa, Asia, and Oceania. In contrast, Europe stands out as the only continent without a single dominant exporter, resulting in a more balanced and diversified trade landscape. Overall, China, the USA, and Germany emerge as the key players in global exports, continuing to shape the international trade network.

    <div id="section5" class="section">
      <p>
        This section outlines the methodology used to address the first research question of the project. The analysis is based on the CEPII datasets, which have been categorized into two time periods: Pre-COVID (2017, 2018, 2019) and Post-COVID (2020, 2021, 2022). To quantify the strength of an economy, I adopted the Fitness metric, as proposed in the paper "A New Metric for Countries' Fitness and Products' Complexity" by Pietronero et al. (2012). Unlike the traditional Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) matrix, this approach relies on a binary matrix to evaluate a country's economic fitness.
        The Fitness score is computed for each country and for each year. To assess the impact of COVID-19, the average fitness values are calculated separately for the two time periods. The difference between these averages is then taken for each country. The distribution of these differences is presented below:
      </p>
