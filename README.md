# Project3_World_trade_as_a_graph 🌍📊

## Project Descirption
This project is part of the "Data Driven Modeling of Complex Systems" course taught by Prof. Walter Quattrociocchi at Sapienza University of Rome. The goal of this research is to analyze and represent global trade using data-driven modeling and complex systems theory. International trade is the driving force of economies worldwide, but how stable is it? Can it adapt to external events, or can it suffer significant and lasting impacts? This study seeks to answer these questions by representing global trade as a graph and analyzing its key properties.

# Project Structure
The project is structured into several sections, accessible via an interactive menu, including:
- Introduction and data sources 📊 \
- Structural properties of the global trade graph 🔗 \
- Graph-based visualization of international trade networks 🌎 \
- Analysis of COVID-19's impact on economies and trade interdependence 🦠💰 \

# Why an HTML file?
For this version of the project, I decided to publish it as an interactive HTML file instead of a traditional static report. I wanted to experiment with something new, offering a more dynamic and engaging way to explore the data and I thought the HTML version of the project could have suited this case. Images and graphs are well-centered and structured, while smooth transitions enhance the overall user experience.
